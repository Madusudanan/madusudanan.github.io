        <td>
            <p>User for : Markdown editing</p>
            If you ever wanted to preview markdown and how it wanted to look like, epic editor can be a pretty handy one.No installation required,
            head over to the website, the tool is entirely developed in Javascript and hence client side and can be used offline.

        <td>
            <p>User for : Version Control</p>
            When it comes to Version control, Git is probably most widely used and one of the best.It has many cloud providers as well.
            See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8" target="_blank">video</a> for a not gentle introduction to Git.

        <td>Trello</td>
        <td>
            <p>Used for : Task management</p>
            There are many tools for task management, but trello is what I found as the one that stands out for personal usage.Completely free, web based and there are also
            pretty good mobile app counterparts.

        <td>
            <p>Used for : Web development</p>
            What ?? An IDE for web development ? Yes, I used to love brackets until I found webstorm, this is pretty kickass and has a ton of features and a slick UI.Start using
            it and you will fall in love with it.
            <br>
            <br>
            P.S - It is commercial, but you can get a free license for open source projects.

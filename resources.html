<p>This page lists all the tools/resources that I have come across that are really good at what they do.Of course, there might be better ones.Do drop me a note if you find any.</p>

<h2>Markdown editing</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://stackedit.io/">Stack edit</a> is a good tool for markdown editing</li>
    <li><a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dilinger</a> also seems cool</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>IDEs</h2>
<p>
This blog itself is developed by using an open source license for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">webstorm</a>.While I personally think jetbrains products are kickass(I am in no way affiliated to them).
There are other IDEs as well, jetbrains offers community editions of many of their IDEs such as Intellij,Pycharm which offer good support for the core language.

Everything is an Object
-----------------------

Scala is a multi-paradigm language, mainly a combination of object oriented and functional.

To support this kind of a language, it is necessary to formulate an idea around which things are built. 
As we saw earlier, in scala there are no primitive types and everything is an object. This is not be confused with singleton objects which we saw in part 4, but object
as in instance of a class. In the rest of this article and object means an instance of a class an in regular java speak.

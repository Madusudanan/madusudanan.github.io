Back in the days of assembly programming, there were something called [sub-routines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine){:target="_blank"} 

The same ideas evolved to what methods are today.A simple way to organize programs into little chunks that do something unique.

Sub-routines,Procedures,Functions,Methods may or may not mean the same thing and it is really hard to give a generalized difference.It has different meanings depending upon the programming language under consideration.

In scala, we care only about Functions and Methods.They mean different things and understanding the difference is imperative

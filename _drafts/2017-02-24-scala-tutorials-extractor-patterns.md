Just some notes

1) Calling a variable and a method is one and the same to the caller. This is because if the apply method. Scala compiler translates it to the apply call

2) Update is also a method in scala just like apply

3) In a normal class you can create a companion object to it and then use the apply method inside it. Now the class can be created without the new keyword

4) Avoiding the new keyword kinds of creates good syntax. The new is actually visual noise.

Extractors
----------

So far we have seen two of scala's so called magic methods i.e the [apply](/blog/scala-tutorials-part-15-the-apply-method/) 
and [update](/blog/scala-tutorials-part-17-the-update-method/) methods. In this article we will look at another one that is central
to pattern matching i.e un-apply (also called extractors) and this sort of completes the cycle with apply, update and un-apply.

This is part 18 of the scala tutorial series. Check [here](/tags/#Scala) for the full series.

An extractor is the opposite of a constructor. Constructors are used to creates new objects while an extractor extracts parameters from
a created object. `Un-apply` is the way in which you create an extractor. 

This will seem confusing in the first place but it will get cleared once we look at examples.

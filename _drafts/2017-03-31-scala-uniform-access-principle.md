Uniform Access Principle
-----------------------

The [Uniform access principle](http://wiki.c2.com/?UniformAccessPrinciple){:target="_blank"} is a programming concept that goes simply as

<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage 
or through computation. <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

It was put forth by [Bertrand Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer){:target="_blank"} in his book called 
[Object oriented software construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Software_Construction){:target="_blank"}

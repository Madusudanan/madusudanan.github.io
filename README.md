## About Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator that plays nicely with Github pages and is extremely quick to set up.

## Get Started
Once you have Jekyll set up, the first thing you'll want to do is edit the `_config.yml` file. Change the name, description, author and url. An example localhost url is commented out for conveniently switching between local and production environments.

    name: "Heather"
    description: "A Hyperminimal Jekyll Theme"
    author: "Jxnblk"

    # url: "http://localhost:4000"
    url: "http://jxnblk.github.io/Heather"

    exclude: [README.md, Rakefile]
    paginate: 16
    permalink: /:title

## Creating a Post
Once you've customized the settings, use the `_posts/2103-01-01-template.md` file as a starting point for creating a post. Rename the file to reflect the date and title of your post. Open the file, change the title and write your own content.
